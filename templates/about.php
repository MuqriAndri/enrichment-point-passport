    <p>Enrichment Point Passport is a smart, student-friendly platform designed to revolutionize how co-curricular activities (CCAs) are tracked and managed. Created as part of a final-year project, this system blends modern technology with real campus needs — helping students explore events, log their attendance using real-time geolocation, and earn enrichment points seamlessly.

        Built with both usability and accountability in mind, the platform introduces features like swipeable event cards, time-based attendance windows, and dynamic location verification — ensuring every student effort is recognized and every activity is logged with accuracy.

        For schools and administrators, Enrichment Point Passport reduces paperwork, streamlines reporting, and provides reliable insights into student engagement.

        Our mission is simple: to create a digital tool that motivates participation, supports student growth beyond academics, and empowers schools with meaningful data — all through one interactive, centralized platform.</p>
